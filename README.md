# Belly_Button_Biodiversity
Exploring Belly Button Biodiversity with Plotly, JavaScript, HTML and CSS

## Purpose

A scientist for Improbable Beef, a plant based alternative meat manufacturer, is studying different types of bacteria in order to find one with a similar quality to beef.

She has taken samples from the bellybuttons of a number of volunteers. 

This project creates visualizations of the collected bacterial data utilizing JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.ja.

These data visualizations allow each volunteer can identify the top 10 bacterial species that were found in their respective belly buttons.


## Horizontal Bar Chart of Top 10 Bacterial Specimens 

- drop down menu allows each user to select their volunteer ID number to filter the data and view their top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) that were found in their navel.
